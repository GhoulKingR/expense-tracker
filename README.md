# Expense tracker

I’ll build an expense tracker app in python. I’m thinking between making the app cli or web. I think I’ll start with cli. The app will have a section that asks the user either to create a tab, select tab or delete a tab. when the user selects “create a tab” the app will prompt them for the name of the tab, and then they go to the tab dashboard. If the user selects a tab they’ll go to the tab dashboard. If the user wants to delete a tab, it’ll ask them what tab and if they are sure. In the tab dashboard, a user can add an expense or gain, and check the balance they have now, or show the expenses within a time frame. Everything starts with 0. The user should also be allowed to move to the previous page.
