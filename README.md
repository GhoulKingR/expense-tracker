# Expense tracker

[x] I’ll build an expense tracker app in python. I’m thinking I'll make it a CLI application.

[x]The app will have a section that asks the user either to create a tab, select tab or delete a tab.

[x]when the user selects “create a tab” the app will prompt them for the name of the tab, and then they go to the tab dashboard.

[x]If the user selects a tab they’ll go to the tab dashboard.

[ ]If the user wants to delete a tab, it’ll ask them what tab and if they are sure.

[ ]In the tab dashboard, a user can add an expense or gain, and check the balance they have now, or show the expenses within a time frame.

[ ]Everything starts with 0.

[ ]The user should also be allowed to move to the previous page.

Checking expenses will be another software sitting right beside this

datetime.now().strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")}

# Setup

```bash
chmod +x expense
```
